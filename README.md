# catpicker-rs
Machine Learning experiments in Rust.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
* [Rust](https://www.rustup.rs/)
* [Cargo](https://crates.io/)
* [CIFAR-10 datasets](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-binary.tar.gz)

### Building
Download the CIFAR-10 bin datasets and extract them in the root folder
of the project, i.e:
```
/project-root-dir/
-- /cifar-10-batches-bin/
---- /data_batch_1.bin
---- .... etc
```

Use Cargo to build and run so that the dependencies are staisfied.
